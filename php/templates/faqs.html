							 Excellence programs are usually limited at their kick-off stages to a collection of awards and after a few years they start transforming to a more comprehensive excellence program, but SKGEP started where others aspired to reach. The excellence awards are one of the four pillars on which the SKGEP is based; namely, the awareness and learning pillar, knowledge transfer pillar, building capabilities pillar and the excellence award pillar. Each of these pillars has a group of initiatives, activities and projects through which motivation and building of excellence constituents of the federal government take place. These will be successively announced at a later stage. In the Emirates Award for Excellent Government Performance, for example, the SKGEP considers the volume and nature of work of the federal entities, where an award is allocated to ministries and another category for the federal authorities and two categories are determined per each award based on the size and number of employees of the participating entity; the first category consists of entities with more than 900 employees and the second consists of entities with smaller number of employees. Additionally, unprecedented categories were developed that have not been previously raised by excellence awards, including, for example, best practices awards covering the fields of innovation, performance management, knowledge management and government communication.
